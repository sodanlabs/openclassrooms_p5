# Projet 5 du parcours DÃ©veloppeur Web d'OpenClassrooms

This is the full project for the Web Developer path.

### Prerequisites ###

This folder contains the whole project in itself, the frontend as well as the backend (as git submodule).

You will need to have Git, Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.


### Installation ###

Clone this repo. From within the project folder, run `git submodule init` to register the path for the backend folder and then run `git submodule update ` to upload it.
Once you have downloaded the files from the backend, you must run `npm install` in the backend folder.
You can then run the server with `node server`.

The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.

You can now open the index.html page of the frontend folder with your favourite browser.
